# Implementation Plan for Repository Restructuring

This document outlines the step-by-step plan for implementing the improved repository structure as described in `repository_structure.md`.

## Phase 1: Preparation

1. **Backup the Repository**
   - Create a backup of the entire repository before making any changes
   - Commit all current changes to create a clean starting point

2. **Create a New Branch**
   - Create a new branch for the restructuring work: `git checkout -b restructure-repository`

3. **Analyze Dependencies**
   - Identify all import statements in the codebase
   - Document the dependencies between modules

## Phase 2: Directory Structure Creation

1. **Create New Directories**
   ```bash
   # Create config directories
   mkdir -p config/schemas
   mkdir -p config_files
   
   # Create core directory
   mkdir -p core
   
   # Create scripts directory
   mkdir -p scripts
   
   # Create bot.py entry point
   touch bot.py
   ```

2. **Move Existing Files**
   - Move files from the redundant `Dmarket_Telegram_bot` directory to their corresponding locations in the new structure
   - Ensure that no files are lost during the move

## Phase 3: Configuration Management Implementation

1. **Implement Configuration Manager**
   - Create the configuration manager as described in `configuration_improvements.md`
   - Move configuration-related code to the new `config` module

2. **Create Configuration Files**
   - Create environment-specific configuration files in the `config_files` directory
   - Convert existing environment variables to the new configuration format

## Phase 4: Internationalization Implementation

1. **Implement Translation System**
   - Ensure the i18n module is properly set up as described in `i18n_improvements.md`
   - Create the necessary locale directories and files

2. **Update User-Facing Messages**
   - Wrap user-facing messages with the translation function
   - Create translation files for supported languages

## Phase 5: Code Refactoring

1. **Update Import Statements**
   - Update all import statements to reflect the new directory structure
   - Fix any broken imports

2. **Standardize Naming Conventions**
   - Ensure consistent naming conventions across the codebase
   - Rename files and directories as needed

3. **Remove Redundant Code**
   - Identify and remove duplicate code
   - Consolidate similar functionality

## Phase 6: Entry Points

1. **Create/Update Entry Points**
   - Ensure `dmarket_parser_main.py`, `worker.py`, and `bot.py` are properly set up
   - Update the entry points to use the new configuration system

2. **Update Docker Configuration**
   - Update `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` to reflect the new structure
   - Ensure that the Docker setup works with the new structure

## Phase 7: Testing

1. **Run Tests**
   - Run the existing test suite to ensure everything still works
   - Fix any failing tests

2. **Manual Testing**
   - Manually test the application to ensure it works as expected
   - Test all major functionality

## Phase 8: Documentation

1. **Update Documentation**
   - Update the README.md file to reflect the new structure
   - Create additional documentation as needed

2. **Create Architecture Documentation**
   - Create architecture documentation in the `docs` directory
   - Document the new structure and its benefits

## Phase 9: Finalization

1. **Review Changes**
   - Review all changes to ensure they meet the requirements
   - Get feedback from team members

2. **Commit and Push**
   - Commit all changes with descriptive commit messages
   - Push the changes to the remote repository

3. **Create Pull Request**
   - Create a pull request for the restructuring work
   - Address any feedback from reviewers

## Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Description | Estimated Time |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | Preparation | 1 day |
| 2 | Directory Structure Creation | 2 days |
| 3 | Configuration Management Implementation | 2 days |
| 4 | Internationalization Implementation | 2 days |
| 5 | Code Refactoring | 3 days |
| 6 | Entry Points | 1 day |
| 7 | Testing | 2 days |
| 8 | Documentation | 1 day |
| 9 | Finalization | 1 day |

Total estimated time: 15 days

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Backup Strategy**
   - Maintain regular backups throughout the implementation
   - Use version control to track all changes

2. **Incremental Testing**
   - Test each phase before moving to the next
   - Run the test suite frequently to catch issues early

3. **Rollback Plan**
   - Have a plan for rolling back changes if necessary
   - Document the steps for reverting to the previous structure

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. All functionality works as expected in the new structure
2. The test suite passes
3. The codebase is more maintainable and easier to understand
4. The redundant `Dmarket_Telegram_bot` directory is eliminated
5. Configuration management is centralized
6. Internationalization is properly implemented
7. The directory structure is logical and consistent
